# Implementation overview

**Next action:** Preserve the now-observed real agent loop and move the next connected evaluation back toward ordinary player-facing gameplay rather than rerunning this harness merely to obtain a green result. The corrected Greywake confirmation used Sol for two rounds: a valid `needs_context` action, one application-owned lexical read, then a complete 1,068-token final under the new 1,792-token reserve. The final answered the retrieved fact exactly and strongly matched the captured quiet-eerie profile, but publication correctly failed because its private metadata selected two creative directions and put a memory item ID in continuity-note evidence. The owning memory prompt now states both boundaries explicitly; Storyteller build and 39/39 tests pass. No further provider call is justified until it answers a new gameplay question. This establishes genuine model-directed retrieval and grounded composition for one case—not reliability, universal gameplay quality or a need for an unbounded file-browsing agent. Gameplay quality remains judged against the captured story and Storyteller configuration. UI polish is lower priority.

The connected acceptance target is the [generative POC proof](engineering/connected-poc-proof.md): an owner-enjoyable 10–15-turn Seyda campaign with choice, mechanics, elapsed time, durable reward, canonical change and later recall. The [gold session](technical/playthroughs/harbor-session.md) remains the deterministic mechanics/time oracle; Seyda Neen is the first generated experience proof.

**Lifecycle:** Pre-POC, solo development on `main`. Deliberate bounded local use of verified OpenRouter free models is authorized for gameplay; paid calls need separate authorization. Checks are optional per [verification policy](../.agents/rules/verification.md).

## Implemented boundary

| Area | Exists now | Important limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace | Next.js web, NestJS API, Temporal worker/workflows, PostgreSQL; shared game, contracts, application and Storyteller packages | See the [code map](engineering/code-navigation.md) for actual wiring; architecture specs also describe unbuilt capabilities |
| Identity and creation | Stored sessions, GitHub OAuth integration, owned versioned drafts, profile selection, persistent opening review and idempotent Start | Real OAuth needs credentials/manual verification; local Chamber supplies a development session |
| Narrative rehearsal | Authored opening, choices, continuity notes, saved waits, pause/resume, story list and history | Exercises persistence and UI, not arbitrary-premise generation |
| Mechanical actions | Generated public offers backed by immutable private plans; automatic/check choices expose authored durations and become durable finite executions | Browser experience, actor/site occurrence scope and irrecoverable target invalidation remain separate work; human taste is unverified |
| Mechanical policy | Pure validation of shape, evidence, character/story facts, quantity minimums, abilities and skills; explicit story-fact declaration with receipt provenance | No general rule/target invention or story-fact update/retirement |
| Character capabilities | Selected D&D scores plus currently applicable abilities and declared skills/proficiencies | Mechanical creation still begins from developer-authored character seeds |
| Content | Validated JSON mechanical seeds, narrative rehearsal and creative profiles; server-supplied mechanical catalogue summaries | No species/world-specific engine branches; fixtures do not establish general world understanding |
| Time and settings | Campaign-owned mechanical clock, calendar projection, finite world obligations, activity/finite-action execution gate, pause/resume/pace controls | Explicit abandonment, named-capacity concurrency and broader process families are unimplemented |
| Storyteller tasks | Opening, continuation, consequence and report-only contracts; bounded context, multi-round retrieval, execution, publication and recovery | Connected retrieved-evidence publication and live-model quality evidence remain unproved |
| Context | Recent passages plus mandatory source-backed notes; bounded exact world/rule sections and campaign documents | No archived-memory query, automatic returning-identity selection or semantic retrieval |
| Provider/accounting | Explicit opt-in adapter, durable reservations, usage windows, dispatch authority recheck, safe blocker projection | Commercial authority selection and the broader failure/hold QA matrix remain |
| Exploration | Local Chamber inspection, manual QA catalogue, durable run/evidence records | Rich trace explorer and planned fault/mechanical scenarios remain unfinished |
| World/showcase | Small authored transfer and chronology examples | General inventory/combat/travel, shared worlds and public visitor onboarding remain unimplemented |

## What can be tried

Launch `pnpm chamber` and use `/stories` to select a storyteller, save a draft, review an opening and Start. `/demo` is a separate browser-only presentation prototype. Use [development](development.md) for setup and [QA journeys](engineering/qa-journeys.md) for manual evidence recording. An authored rehearsal is not proof of a functioning generative DM.

## Verification evidence

Checks remain optional. Passing compilation or scripted tests does not certify meaningful agency, live continuity, prose quality or general mechanics. One live Gate-1 call verified the real OpenRouter transport and durable settlement path; further paid calls require separate authorization.
